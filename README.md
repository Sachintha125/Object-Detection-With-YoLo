# Object-Detection-With-YoLo
Object detection using YOLO object detector

## Overview
This project implements an object detection system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) models. It provides a GUI to detect objects from live cameras or video files with customizable features such as camera selection, detection areas, detectable vehicle types, and YOLO models.

## Features
- Real-time Detection: Detect objects from live cameras or pre-recorded videos.
- Customizable Detection Area: Define specific areas for detection.
- Vehicle Type Filtering: Choose which vehicle types to detect.
- YOLO Model Customization: Use different YOLO model configurations.
- GPU Acceleration: Leverage GPU for faster inference.
- User-Friendly GUI: Easily control the system through an interactive interface.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following:

- Hardware:

  - A CUDA-compatible GPU (optional).
  - Webcams configured (for live detection).

- Software Dependencies:
  - Python 3.9 
  - Install the required Python packages using the provided requirements.txt file:
